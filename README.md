# Hey there, Iâ€™m JoÃ£o!

## About Me

* Currently working full-time at **davinTI Sistemas**, where I develop applications using **Java**, **Spring**, **Postgres / Oracle databases**, and **JavaScript** on the front end.
* I also enjoy building side projects with frameworks and languages such as **Vue**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **JavaScript**.
* Always open to suggestions and feedback to improve my code.

I hold a degree in **System Analysis and Development (UNIP)** and keep expanding my skills through courses and training. My goal is to continuously grow, sharpen both hard and soft skills, and contribute in a meaningful way to the teams and companies I collaborate with.

Alongside development, I also have working knowledge of **Excel, Word, Photoshop, and Blender**, which I use to bring extra value to projects when needed.

## Continuous Learning

Iâ€™ve taken courses that go beyond coding, focusing on interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, and productivity â€” with mentors such as **O Corpo Explica**, **Murilo Gun**, **Thiago Nigro**, **Bruno Perini**, and **Wendell Carvalho**.

These experiences have helped me improve teamwork, emotional management, financial awareness, and time optimization.
